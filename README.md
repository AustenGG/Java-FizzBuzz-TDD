# Java-FizzBuzz-TDD

### In this project I have used test driven development to produce a game of fizzbuzz!

### The program first takes your name and welcomes you then, has input to choose the number of results returned.

#### FizzBuzz works by returning "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "Fizz" for multiples of 3 and or "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 otherwise, returns the standard number
